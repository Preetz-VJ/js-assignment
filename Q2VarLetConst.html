    <h2>Difference between var,let and const</h2><hr/>
    <br/>
    <p>* var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.<br/>
       * var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope<br/> * let variables can be updated but not re-declared<br/> * const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.<br/>
        * They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.<br/>
       * While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.</p>
