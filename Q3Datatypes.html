    <h2>Data types in Js</h2>
   
    <p>JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:</p>
    <p>
        <h3>JavaScript String:</h3>
        A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".<br/>
        Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:<br/>
        Eg:var carName1 = "Volvo XC60";   // Using double quotes<br/>
        var carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';   // Using single quotes
    </p>
    <p><h3>Javasript numbers</h3>
        JavaScript has only one type of numbers.<br/>Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:
        <br/>Eg:var x1 = 34.00;     // Written with decimals<br/>
        var x2 = 34;        // Written without decimal<br/>
        var y = 123e5;      // 12300000<br/>
var z = 123e-5;     // 0.00123<br/>
        </p>
        <p><h3>Javascript Boolean</h3>
            Booleans can only have two values: true or false<br/>Eg:var x = 5;<br/>
            var y = 5;<br/>
            var z = 6;<br/>
            (x == y)       // Returns true<br/>
            (x == z)       // Returns false</p>
            <p><h3>JavaScript Arrays</h3>
                JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.<br/>
                
                Array items are separated by commas.<br/>
                The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names):<br/>
                
                Example
                var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];</p>
                <p><h3>JavaScript Objects</h3>
                    JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.<br/>
                    
                    Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.<br/>
                    
                    Example<br/>
                    var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};</p>
                   
<p><h3> Undefined</h3>
    In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.<br/>
Example<br/>
var car;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined
<p>
    <h3>
        Null
    </h3>
In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.<br/>

Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.<br/>

You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.<br/>

You can empty an object by setting it to null:<br/>

Example<br/>
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};<br/>
person = null;    // Now value is null, but type is still an object
